# 📁 Visual Assets Repository
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

This repository serves as a **central media repository** (images, screenshots, diagrams, among others) used in the `README.md` files of my other GitHub projects.

## 🔗 Purpose

Avoid duplicating images across multiple repositories and keep visual files centralized and organized, making it easier to:

- Provide a stable reference for use in other repositories
- Allow fast and centralized image updates
- Reduce weight and complexity in code repositories

## 🧠 What is it for?

When a `README.md` from another project needs to display an image, like this:

```markdown
![System Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AntonioJavaDeveloper/assets/main/{repository-name}/images/demo.gif)
```

It will be served directly from this repository.

## 🗂 Recommended Structure

```bash
assets/
│
├── repository1/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── demo.gif
│   │   └── architecture.png
├── repository2/
│   └── images/
│       └── example.jpg
```

I organize files into subfolders named after the project they are used in, making maintenance and understanding the purpose of each image easier.

## 📌 Notes

- **Attention**: this repository does not contain source code.
- Files stored here are **exclusively used as visual support resources**.
- Image URLs should use `raw.githubusercontent.com` for proper display on and off GitHub.
